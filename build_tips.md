# After the project is build since there is HARDCoded Assests placed in code u need to DO this:

1. Remove HardCoded assests from the code bofore building
 OR
2. Add assets folder provided by the release section of the build under this repo.

LAST but Not the least u need to place Shaders vertex , and frag directly acc to path provided under renderer.cpp for exe to access shaders while runtime.

< I Know its mess now>
