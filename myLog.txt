GLSL std140 saves data in 16 bit format total object takes 64 bytes hence i added padding to adjust that
learned alignas(BYTESIZE) in cpp which determines the layout of the data in bytes used in struct

	TIME UTELIZED -1 day 
ADDED Light manager which is altered using the Imgui its its working compleatly best :{}}]
Updating the light uniform block every frame takes away 400 fPS which is quite much 


calibrate details about perlin octaves 

TIP >>>> ADD DEFINE GLERROR CHECKER which tells the error causing location where that call is done
NEXT JOB ->>> MAKE ALL GL commands in Renderer and Separate it form sceneManager -usme data upadate hoga but not Gl stuff abhi ke liye mene sceneManger me hi kar diya
